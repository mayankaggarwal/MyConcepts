# Repository for 'Building Apps with Node.js' & 'Using Node.js with Visual Studio Code' Microsoft Virtual Academy Videos

This is the repository containing the source code for all the demos and the PowerPoint presentations in the "Building Apps with Node.js" & "Using Node.js with Visual Studio Code" Microsoft Virtual Academy courses. These courses were developed by [Rami Sayar](https://twitter.com/ramisayar) && [Stacey Mulcahy](https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes), both technical evangelists at Microsoft. 

In [Building Apps with Node.js](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/building-apps-with-node-js-jump-start-8422), we teach how to develop web applications with Node.js and touch on topics like how to incorporate two-way communication into applications. In this course, you can see step-by-step demos and get practical tips and detailed explanations. By the end of the day, you know how to set up Node.js on your Windows machine, develop a web front end with Express, deploy an Express app to Azure, use Socket.IO to add a real-time layer, and bring it all together.

In [Using Node.js with Visual Studio Code](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/liveevents/using-node-js-with-visual-studio-code), we showcase how to write code with Visual Studio Code? Visual Studio Code is far more than a text editor, it works cross platform, looks great, has a ton of cool features, and is becoming increasingly popular! In this course, we walk through the tool's features, learn how to customize them, and explore the key commands. See how to create a basic REST API using Node.js with Express, connect your web app to a database, and learn how to debug Node.js apps using Visual Studio Code. Plus, see how to deploy your sites to Microsoft Azure, and create, test, and schedule Azure Web Jobs.
